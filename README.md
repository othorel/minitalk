</p>

Welcome to **Minitalk**, a C project that implements a communication system between a **server** and a **client** using Unix signals (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`). The goal of this project is to transmit messages from the client to the server bit by bit, improving understanding of inter-process communication and Unix signal handling.

| **Category**               | **Functions**                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Communication**           | `send_message`, `receive_message`                                                                                                              |
| **Signal Handling**         | `signal_handler`, `setup_signal_handlers`                                                                                                       |
| **Client & Server Logic**   | `client`, `server`                                                                                                                              |

## üöÄ Key Features

1. **Signal-Based Communication**:
   - Implement communication between a client and a server using Unix signals (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`), transmitting each character as a sequence of bits.

2. **Send Messages Bit by Bit**:
   - The client sends messages to the server, encoding each character in binary and transmitting it using signals one bit at a time.

3. **Server Receiving Messages**:
   - The server listens for signals, accumulates the bits, and reconstructs the message once all 8 bits of a character are received.

4. **Efficient Signal Management**:
   - Efficient signal handling using Unix signal functions such as `signal()`, with proper error handling and memory management.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

| **File**                | **Description**                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Makefile`              | Automates the compilation process. Run `make` to generate the `client` and `server` executables.           |
| `minitalk.h`            | Header file with function prototypes and necessary includes.                                               |
| `minitalk_bonus.h`      | Header file with function prototypes and necessary includes.                                               |
| `client.c`              | Implementation of the client, responsible for sending the message.                                         |
| `server.c`              | Implementation of the server, responsible for receiving and displaying the message.                        |
| `client_bonus.c`        | Implementation of the client, responsible for sending the message.                                         |
| `server_bonus.c`        | Implementation of the server, responsible for receiving and displaying the message.                        |

## üîß Compilation Instructions

Use the **Makefile** to compile the project.

- **Compile the project:**
  ```bash
  make
  ```
  ```bash
  make bonus
  ```
- **Clean the project: (remove object files)**
  ```bash
  make clean
  ```
- **Full cleanup (remove all generated files):**
  ```bash
  make fclean
  ```
- **Recompile after cleaning:**
  ```bash
  make re
  ```

## üíª Usage

Once compiled, you can use the client and server as follows:

Run the Server
In one terminal window, run the server with this command:
```bash
./server
```
The server will display its PID (process ID), which is needed by the client to send messages.

Run the Client
In another terminal window, run the client with this command, replacing <server_pid> with the server's PID:
```bash
./client <server_pid> "Hello, server!"
```
The client will send the message to the server bit by bit.

## üß™ Testing

To test the correct functionality of Minitalk, you can run the following:

Server Output:
```bash
$ ./server
Server PID: 12345
```
Client Command:
```bash
$ ./client 12345 "Hello, server!"
```
Server Output (after receiving the message):
```bash
received message: Hello, server!
```
